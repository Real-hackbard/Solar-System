The planets and other large objects in orbit around the Sun lie near the [invariable plane of the Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariable_plane#Solar_System), as does Earth's orbit, known as the [ecliptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic), and most closely the orbit of Jupiter, with an inclination to it of 0.3219°. Smaller icy objects such as comets frequently orbit at significantly greater angles to this plane. Most of the planets in the Solar System have secondary systems of their own, being orbited by natural satellites called moons. All of the largest natural satellites are in [synchronous rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking), with one face permanently turned toward their parent. The four giant planets have planetary rings, thin discs of tiny particles that orbit them in unison.

As a result of the [formation of the Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System), planets and most other objects orbit the Sun in the same direction that the Sun is rotating. That is, counter-clockwise, as viewed from above Earth's north pole. There are exceptions, such as [Halley's Comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halley%27s_Comet). Most of the larger moons orbit their planets in prograde direction, matching the direction of planetary rotation; Neptune's moon Triton is the largest to orbit in the opposite, retrograde manner. Most larger objects rotate around their own axes in the [prograde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_and_prograde_motion) direction relative to their orbit, though the rotation of Venus is retrograde.

The [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum) of the Solar System is a measure of the total amount of orbital and rotational momentum possessed by all its moving components. Although the Sun dominates the system by mass, it accounts for only about 2% of the angular momentum.[67][68] The planets, dominated by Jupiter, account for most of the rest of the angular momentum due to the combination of their mass, orbit, and distance from the Sun, with a possibly significant contribution from comets.

# Planets:
According to the [IAU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAU_definition_of_planet) definition, there are eight planets in the Solar System, which are (in increasing distance from the Sun): Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Jupiter is the largest, at 318 Earth masses, whereas Mercury is the smallest, at 0.055 [Earth masses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_mass).

* [Mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet))
  * Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the [smallest in the Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Solar_System_objects_by_size). It is a [rocky planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_planet) with a trace atmosphere and a surface gravity slightly higher than that of Mars. The surface of Mercury is similar to Earth's Moon, being cratered, with an expansive rupes system generated from thrust faults, and bright ray systems, formed by ejecta.
 
* [Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus)
  * Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is often called Earth's "twin" or "sister" among the planets of the Solar System for its orbit being the closest to Earth's, both being terrestrial planets, and having the most similar and nearly equal size, mass, and [surface gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_gravity). Venus, though, is significantly different, especially as it has no liquid water, and its atmosphere is far thicker and denser than that of any other rocky body in the Solar System. The atmosphere is composed mostly of carbon dioxide and has a thick cloud layer of [sulfuric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfuric_acid) that spans the whole planet.

* [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth)
  * Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. This is made possible by Earth being an [ocean world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_world), the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within Earth's land hemisphere.

* [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars)
  * Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. It is also known as the "Red Planet", for its [orange-red appearance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_surface_color). Mars is a desert-like rocky planet with a tenuous atmosphere that is primarily [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide) (CO2). At the average surface level the atmospheric pressure is a few thousandths of Earth's, atmospheric temperature ranges from −153 to 20 °C (−243 to 68 °F), and cosmic radiation is high.

* [Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter)
  * Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun, and the [largest in the Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Solar_System_objects_by_size). It is a gas giant with a mass nearly 2.5 times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined and slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun.

* [Saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn)
  * Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a [gas giant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_giant), with an average radius of about 9 times that of Earth.

* [Uranus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus)
  * Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is a gaseous cyan-coloured [ice giant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_giant). Most of the planet is made of water, ammonia, and [methane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane) in a [supercritical phase of matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercritical_fluid), which astronomy calls "ice" or volatiles.

* [Neptune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune)
  * Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet orbiting the Sun. It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest [giant planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_planet).

</br>

# Minor Planets:
Minor planets or planetoids are astronomical objects that move in a direct orbit around the sun, but do not meet the criteria for classification as a planet – because they have not cleared their orbit accordingly – and furthermore cannot be classified as a comet or meteoroid.

* [Ceres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_(dwarf_planet))
  * Ceres ([minor-planet designation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor-planet_designation): 1 Ceres) is a [dwarf planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_planet) in the main asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.

* [Eris](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eris_(dwarf_planet))
  * Eris (symbol ⯰) is a dwarf planet and a [trans-Neptunian](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Neptunian_object) object (TNO). It is the second-largest known dwarf planet in the Solar System. 

* [Haumea](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haumea_(dwarf_planet))
  * 136108 Haumea (symbol 🝻) is a [dwarf planet](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_planet) in the Solar System. Its discovery was announced in 2005 by astronomers Michael E. Brown, Chad Trujillo and David Rabinowitz of the United States, and J. L. Ortiz of Spain. 

* [Pluto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto)
  * Pluto (minor-planet designation: 134340 Pluto) is a dwarf planet in the [Kuiper belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt), a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. It is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object to directly orbit the Sun.

* [Sedna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedna_(dwarf_planet))
  * Sedna (minor-planet designation: 90377 Sedna) is a dwarf planet in the outermost reaches of the Solar System, orbiting the Sun far beyond the [orbit of Neptune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune#Orbit_and_rotation). It was discovered in 2003, and is roughly 1,000 km in diameter.

# Comets:
A comet is an icy, [small Solar System body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Solar_System_body) or [interstellar object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_object) that warms and begins to release gases when passing close to the Sun, a process called [outgassing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outgassing). This produces an extended, gravitationally unbound atmosphere or coma surrounding the nucleus, and sometimes a tail of gas and dust gas blown out from the coma.

* [Biela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biela%27s_Comet)
  * Biela's Comet or Comet Biela (official designation: 3D/Biela) was a periodic [Jupiter-family comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter-family_comet) first recorded in 1772 by Montaigne and [Messier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Messier) and finally identified as periodic in 1826 by Wilhelm von Biela.

* [Brorsen-Mecalf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/23P/Brorsen%E2%80%93Metcalf)
  * 23P/Brorsen–Metcalf is a [periodic comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_periodic_comets) with an orbital period of 70 years. It fits the classical definition of a [Halley-type comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Halley-type_comets).

* [Brorsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5D/Brorsen)
  * 5D/Brorsen (also known as Brorsen's Comet or Comet Brorsen) was a [periodic Jupiter-family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_periodic_comets) comet discovered on February 26, 1846, by Danish astronomer [Theodor Brorsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Brorsen). The comet was last seen in 1879 and is now considered lost.

* [Encke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Encke)
  * Comet Encke /ˈɛŋki/, or Encke's Comet (official designation: 2P/Encke), is a [periodic comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_periodic_comets) that completes an orbit of the Sun once every 3.3 years.

* [Giacobini–Zinner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21P/Giacobini%E2%80%93Zinner)
  * Comet Giacobini–Zinner (officially designated as 21P/Giacobini–Zinner) is a periodic comet in the Solar System. It was discovered by [Michel Giacobini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Giacobini), who observed it in the constellation of Aquarius on 20 December 1900.

* [Halley](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halley%27s_Comet)
  * Halley's Comet (Comet Halley) is a comet which comes round every 75 or 76 years. When it is near, it can be seen with the naked eye. It will return in 2061.
    The comet is named after [Edmond Halley](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_Halley) (1656–1742), an English astronomer, who predicted the comet's return. Halley's Comet was the first comet to be recognized as periodic. (Periodic means that it comes by Earth regularly.)

* [Herschel–Rigollet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/35P/Herschel%E2%80%93Rigollet)
  * 35P/Herschel–Rigollet is a Halley-type comet with an [orbital period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_period) of 155 years and an [orbital inclination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_inclination) of 64 degrees. It was first discovered by [Caroline Herschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Herschel) on 21 December 1788. Given that the comet has a 155-year orbit involving asymmetric outgassing, and astrometric observations in 1939 were not as precise as modern observations, predictions for the next perihelion passage in 2092 vary by about a month.

* [Kohoutek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/1973_E1_(Kohoutek))
  * Comet Kohoutek (pronounced "ko-HU-tek" /koʊˈhuːtɛk/, or "ko-ho-tek" /koʊhoʊtɛk/), formally designated as C/1973 E1, 1973 XII and 1973f, is a comet that passed close to the Sun towards the end of 1973. 

* [Schwassmann-Wachmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/73P/Schwassmann%E2%80%93Wachmann)
  * 73P/Schwassmann–Wachmann, also known as Schwassmann–Wachmann 3 or SW3 for short, is a periodic comet that has a 5.4 year orbital period and that has been actively [disintegrating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet#Breakup_and_collisions) since 1995. When it came to [perihelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#Perihelion_and_aphelion) (closest approach to the Sun) in March 2017, fragment 73P-BT was separating from the main fragment 73P-C. Fragments 73P-BU and 73P-BV were detected in July 2022.

* [Tempel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10P/Tempel)
  * 10P/Tempel, also known as Tempel 2, is a Jupiter-family comet with a 5.36-year orbit around the Sun. It was discovered on 4 July 1873 by [Wilhelm Tempel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Tempel). At the [perihelion passage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elongation_(astronomy)) on 2 August 2026 the solar elongation is calculated at 164 degrees, with [apparent magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude) approximately 8, with closest approach to Earth on 3 August 2026 at a distance of 0.414 AU (61.9 million km).

* [Churyumov–Gerasimenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/67P/Churyumov%E2%80%93Gerasimenko)
  * 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko (abbreviated as 67P or 67P/C–G) is a Jupiter-family comet. It is originally from the [Kuiper belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt) and has an orbital period of 6.45 years as of 2012, a rotation period of approximately 12.4 hours, and a maximum velocity of 135,000 km/h (38 km/s; 84,000 mph).

# Planetoid:
A planetoid (or minor planet) orbits the Sun but is not a planet or comet.

* [Apollo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_asteroid)
  * The Apollo asteroids are a [group of near-Earth asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-Earth_object#Near-Earth_asteroids) named after [1862 Apollo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1862_Apollo), discovered by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth in the 1930s. They are [Earth-crossing asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Earth-crossing_asteroids) that have an orbital semi-major axis greater than that of the Earth (a > 1 AU) but perihelion distances less than the Earth's aphelion distance (q < 1.017 AU).
